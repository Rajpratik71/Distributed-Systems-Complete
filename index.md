Are you tired of your job?  Do you want to be filthy, filthy rich?  Well, I do.  And today I'm going to spend some time looking into a way I can leverage my ML knowledge, as well as the wide availability of big data cloud infrastructure, to make this dream happen.  In short, we are going to build Skynet for Stocks.  

# Background

Stocks.  What are stocks?  Well, they are probably the easiest way to build wealth.  Stocks represent a share of a company.  If a company does really great things, typically that would result in the company being worth more money, and hence every share of that company increasing.  And, obviously, the opposite is true as well.  

But - stock values fluctuate sometimes WILDLY from day-to-day, hour-to-hour, even second-to-second.  And these flucations aren't due to the second-to-second performance of the employees at Apple.  No, they are the result of many variables from news articles to tweets to celestial phenomena.  That being said, because of these flucations in value, there is always money to be made.  If we knew with relatively high probability that in 30 minutes, the stock price would be 1 cent higher then it is currently, you could make lots of money.

Machine Learning.  What is machine learning?  Well, it's magic.  Atleast for the purposes of this article.  Writing machine learning algorithms, training, testing, can all be a daunting task.  Luckily, Amazon came to the rescue with their platform AWS Sagemaker.  Sagemaker is a ML platform built inside AWS that allows for quick and easy generation of ML models.

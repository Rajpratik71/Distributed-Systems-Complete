----Introduction to SDN:
Network function to be open and programable.
SDN model: 
    application1 application2 application3
          Network operating system
    forwarding device1    forwarding device2
Packet flow: when a packet arrive at a forwarding device, if the forwarding table of that device
contain the entry corresponding to that packet, then the device will directly forward the packet to
output ports. If not, the forwarding device will send request to Network operating system.,
And the application running on the Network operating system will return the enrty to the forwarding device.
The structure:
Network application
Application Interfaces
SDN controller/control plane
SouthBound Interface
Forwarding devices
data plane

Different SDN can comunicate with each other with East/West protocol.
There could be multiple layers of SDN.

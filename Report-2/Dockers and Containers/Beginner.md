**Demand with time**

> We shifted from computer platform to virtualization then to cloud. But, at present era we need container, a prepackaged environment that can be serverless too. In order to make things work faster and efficiently.

> The good point is that unlike in previous times when the when the migration of platform i.e. from local computer to virtualization to cloud was going on we had focus only on facilitating sys admins, now we focus on facilitating developer too.

> Docker is an open-source project and so it lets huge number of people to give their inputs.

> Docker focuses on developing, building, testing, deploying, updating and recovering our project faster.

>Since various department i.e. devops, BI, developer etc. teams work on different technologies it is get very complicated to interact with each other having different hardware/software requirement barriers. But, container acts as a solution to this, synching everything.

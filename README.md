# Distributed Systems Practice
Notes from learning about distributed systems in [GW CS 6421](https://gwdistsys18.github.io/) with [Prof. Wood](https://faculty.cs.gwu.edu/timwood/)

## Area 1 - SDN and NFV
> Introduction to SDN
  - SDN is the separation of the control plane, into a software layer, from the data plane.
  - The goal of SDN is the flexibility of service provisioning rather than faster support.
  - Network functions can be added to the south interface of SDN platforms.
  - SDNs are used to build one large logical network fabric. However, internally the SDN can have hierarchy or clustering to suport features like load balancing and high availability.

# Distributed Systems Practice
Notes from learning about distributed systems in [GW CS 6421](https://gwdistsys18.github.io/) with [Prof. Wood](https://faculty.cs.gwu.edu/timwood/)

## Area 1 Docker
### Beginner
1. Why Docker
	- This video discussed the trend of advancements in computer science
	it acknowledged that Docker and containerization in general is a
	trend that many people are moving towards due to it's ease in setup
	and the speed associated with spinning up a new container.
2. DevOps Docker Beginners Guide
	- This tutorial started with a few simple commands and explained what
	docker is doing when those commands are run.
	- This tutorial then uses a lightweight version of linux to run some
	more basic commands in while continueing to explain Docker infrastructure
	further.
	- The tutorial helps to further solidify my understanding of the
	differences between VMs and containers. Primarily the focus is on
	the speed with which a contianer can be spun up and killed. Fast
	enough to run a single command and get an output within a reasonable
	amount of time.
	- Security is inforced through the separate instances of contianers.
	although n contiars can be run using the same instance they all have
	isolation ensure because they are executing in different contexts
	while sharing the same image.
	- Docker speed and isolation can be beneficial for app testing. This
	is an interesting idea, using a container to test changes to an
	application while preserving a running context.

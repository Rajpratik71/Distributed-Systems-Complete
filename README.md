# Distributed Systems Practice

## Docker and Containers
### What is container
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. Each container can have its own distribution but must share the same host kernel.


### What is docker
Docker is all about speed. if you don't have containers today, you need to deal with multiple types of applications which may have their own dependencies. Then you need to run them on developer machines and production. It's so complicated.

Containers allow you to package same way, run and test same way regardless of OS and setups.

A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

### Docker Architecture
##### Clent
##### Docker Host
- Docker deamon

- Containers

- Images
##### Registry

### Docker Command Line
|command      | function
|-------------|----------------
|docker pull  |get images
|docker build | build images
|docker images| list all images
|docker run   | run container
|docker ps    |list all running containers

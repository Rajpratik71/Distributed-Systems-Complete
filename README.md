## Docker and Containers

### **Beginer Level**

1. Video: Why Docker?
    * Docker is an opensource project released in 2013. It is a shift in frastructure that will affect whole IT related asepct.
    * Recap:
      * 90's: Mainframe to PC
      * 00's: Beramental to Virtual
      * 10's: Datacenter to Cloud
      * Now: Host to Container (Serverless)
    * Migration is hard. But Docker is focused on the migration experience because it was created for developer but system administers.
    * Fastest growing technology.
    * Docker make whole ecosystem of IT faster.
    * Applications runs in different enviorments. Docker allow users to get rid of different enviorments.
    * Docker frees maintains resources such that engineers have more time to innovate.

# Distributed Systems Practice
Notes from learning about distributed systems in [GW CS 6421](https://gwdistsys18.github.io/) with [Prof. Wood](https://faculty.cs.gwu.edu/timwood/)

## Docker and Containers
> **why docker**

* Host to container (serverless)

* Migrating is the key and hard part focused on Docker

* Containers are the "Fastest Growing Cloud Enabling Tecnology"

* All about speed

* Reduce complexity

> **DevOps Docker Beginners Guide**

* Basic docker CLI syntax

    -```pull``` fetches a conainer image from the registry and saves it on your system.
    
    -```docker image``` interact with images loaded on the system. 
    
    -```docker container run``` run an application within a specific container. Once the application has run, the                                                       container shuts down.
    
    -```docker container run -it``` keep a container alive in an interactive envornment.
    
    -```docker container ls``` list all running containers.
    
    -```docker container start <container_id>``` start a specific container.
    
    -```docker container execute <container_id>``` interact with a running container.

* Concepts

    -Container is application abstraction, where as virtual machines are hardware abstraction

    -The Docker Registry is the location Docker looks to pull containers. In the default case, it is the Docker Store.

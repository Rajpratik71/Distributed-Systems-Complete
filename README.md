# Distributed Systems Practice
Notes from learning about distributed systems in [GW CS 6421](https://gwdistsys18.github.io/) with [Prof. Wood](https://faculty.cs.gwu.edu/timwood/)

## Docker and Containers
1. Why Docker? (10min)
* Docker (containerization) is becoming more popular
* Containerization can reduce cost and complexity
2. DevOps Docker Beginners Guide (45min)
* Docker image is a snapshot of a Docker container (can be obtained from Docker Store)
* Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image
* Use `docker run -it` to run the container under interactive mode
* The change in one container will not affect the image or other containers
3. What are Containers? (18min)
* Container
4. VMs Versus Containers (8min)
* VMs vs Containers
5. Docker Intro (20min)
* Docker
6. Doing more with Docker Images (30min)
* Docker images
7. VMs Versus Containers Deep Dive (9min)
* VMs vs Containers
8. Docker Networking (30min)
* Docker networking
9. Swarm Mode Introduction (30min)
* Swarm
10. Kubernetes vs Swarm (4min)
* Kubernetes vs Swarm
11. Kubernetes in 5 Minutes (5min)
* Kubernetes
12. Learn more about Kubernetes on your own (30min)
* Kubernetes
13. Install Docker on a cluster of EC2 VMs and use Kubernetes to orchestrate them (90min)
* //TODO

## Cloud Web Applications
1. AWS Tutorial: Launch a VM (15min)
* Choose the EC2 instance with the proper computation power and storage on AWS console
* Choose the right OS (linux distribution) for the EC2
* How to create a key pair for SSH login
* How to terminate the EC2 instance
2. QwikLab: Intro to S3 (12min)
* S3 stands for Simple Storage Service, which provides online storage
* User can manage the permission on each object, or change the permission of the entire bucket by editing the bucket policy
* S3 can store different version of each object by enabling versioning

Notes from learning about distributed systems in [GW CS 6421](https://gwdistsys18.github.io/) with [Prof. Wood](https://faculty.cs.gwu.edu/timwood/)

## Cloud Web Apps
### AWS Tutorial: Launch a VM - 30 min ###
**Time: 15 minutes**
- UI is pretty intuitive
- Roles is the most interesting thing to do with EC2
- Record IP and ssh in using credentials

### QwikLab: Intro to S3 - 30 min ###
**Time: 25 minutes**
- S3 buckets are an abstraction over disk, function mostly as a way to store and serve persistent web objects.
- Versioning is very useful. Upload a picture with an identical name and it automatically catalogs the old one!
- Object permissions are a little less intuitive but the policy generator is very helpful.

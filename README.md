## Docker and Containers
### Beginner Level
[Why Docker?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYDHUTHLf8U&t=0s&list=PLBmVKD7o3L8tQzt8QPCINK9wXmKecTHlM&index=23)

This video covers the whys and whats of how the Docker got started, what problems it solves and why should we be learning it.
Learning docker is really important, like the author said, containers are the nextonce-in-a-decade shift in infrastructure and process that make or break you.

**What is Docker:** 
Docker is a computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization, also known as "containerization".

**Key points:**

1). Yet unlikes previous shifts, like mainframe to PC, Baremetal to virtual and Datacenter to cloud, Docker is focused on the migration experience. 

2). To answer why do we need docker and what is the real benefit, Docker is all about speed and covers the entire lifecycle of software managment.

3). Comtainers reduce the complexity. It allows us to package the same way regardless of our perating systems. It allows us to distribute the software regardless of the setup it. It allows us to run and test the software everywhere we are running it.

4). Docker is freeing up a lot of those rasks of the maintenance of stuff and allowing us to get more of our time to innovate. 

5). Docker is the core essence that you need to understand first but once you've moved beyond that you are probably need to use other tools for filling the gaps in your toolset.

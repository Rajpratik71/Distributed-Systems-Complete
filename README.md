Before we go ahead and know what AWS is and what services it offers, it’s very important to understand the basic core terms used in AWS. The oversimplified version of definition would be much easy for the very beginners who would like to know about this platform. 

VPC (Virtual private cloud): It’s a dedicated section of cloud provided by AWS to all its users which isolates other users on same platform to access it
Aws Ec2 (Elastic Cloud Compute):  It’s a virtual equivalent of the computer sitting in front of you, primarily used for processing power 
Instance:  It’s a dedicated piece of virtual computer provided to a customer 
S3 (Simple Storage service): It is a cloud supported storage service provided by AWS 
DynamoDB: It’s a NoSQL database provided by AWS as a service

## Docker Container
### Beginner Level: Docker Container
#### [Video: Why Docker?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYDHUTHLf8U&t=0s&list=PLBmVKD7o3L8tQzt8QPCINK9wXmKecTHlM&index=23)  
Time: 15 min   

1. Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Using Docker, you can quickly deploy and scale applications into any environment and know your code will run. 
2. Amazon ECS uses Docker images in task definitions to launch containers on EC2 instances in your clusters.

#### [Lab: DevOps Docker Beginners Guide](https://training.play-with-docker.com/ops-s1-hello/)  
Time: 1 hr  

1. Running your first container  
	Firstly, log into a docker sandbox environment. Type: "docker container run hello-world" to run the fist container. Container is different to VM in that A container is an application abstraction;  
  
2. Docker Image
	The pull command fetches the alpine image from the Docker registry and saves it in our system.

3. Containers and images are different concept.  
	__Images__: The file system and configuration(read-only) of application which are used to create containers.   
	__Containers__: Containers are running instances of Docker images. Containers run the actual applications. A container includes an application and all of its dependencies. It shares the kernel with other containers and runs as an isolated process in user space on the host OS.  
  
4. Container Isolation  
	Even though two containers share the same image, these two instances are separated from each other. No matter what happens in an instance, it won't affect other instances. 
	This is a critical security concept in the world of Docker containers! Even though each docker container run command used the same alpine image, each execution was a separate, isolated container. Each container has a separate filesystem and runs in a different namespace; by default a container has no way of interacting with other containers, even those from the same image.
	
## Cloud Web Apps
### Beginner Level: Cloud Web Apps
#### [AWS Tutorial: Launch a VM](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/launch-a-virtual-machine/)  
Time: 30 min   
1. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is the Amazon Web Service you use to create and run virtual machines in the cloud. AWS calls these virtual machines 'instances'.
2. Steps
	   
	
	Step 1: Launch an Amazon EC2 Instance
	
	Login in and open the Amazon EC2 console, then click Launch Instance to create and configure your virtual machine.
	
	Step 2: Configure your Instance
	
	Important: After you download the MyKeyPair key, you will want to store your key in a secure location. If you lose your key, you won't be able to access your instance. If someone else gets access to your key, they will be able to access your instance. This key will be used in future.
	
	Step 3: Connect to your Instance
	
	Step 4: Terminate Your Instance
	
	You can easily terminate the instance from the EC2 console. In fact, it is a best practice to terminate instances you are no longer using so you donâ€™t keep getting charged for them.
	
	Important: I once forgot to terminate the instance and found out later that my account instance usage added up many hours.
	
	
	Summary: This is the basic usage of EC2, not difficulty.

	
#### [QwikLab: Intro to S3](https://awseducate.qwiklabs.com/focuses/30?parent=catalog)  
Time: 1 hr 

 Amazon S3 is a cloud computing web service offered by Amazon Web Services. Amazon S3 provides object storage through web services interfaces. 
 
1. Create a Bucket  
	Every object in Amazon S3 is stored in a bucket  
  
2. Upload an Object to the Bucket
	An object can be any kind of file: a text file, a photo, a video, a zip file, etc. Add an object to Amazon S3 to let it available in network with permission

3. Make Your Object Public
  
	Configure permissions on your object so that it is publicly accessible. The object is private by default.
	
4. Create a Bucket Policy

	Bucket Policy is a set of permissions associated with an Amazon S3 bucket. It can be used to control access to a whole bucket or to specific directories within a bucket.

5. Explore Versioning

	Versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. You can use versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your Amazon S3 bucket. With versioning you can easily recover from both unintended user actions and application failures.

#### [AWS Tutorial: Install a LAMP Web Server on Amazon Linux 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-lamp-amazon-linux-2.html)  
Time: 60 min   


LAMP is an archetypal model of web service stacks, named as an acronym of the names of its original four open-source components: the GNU/Linux operating system, the Apache HTTP Server, the MySQL relational database management system, and the PHP programming language(from Wikipedia).

Part One: Prepare the LAMP Server

1. Connect to your instance.   
	It seems instance is one of the core components of AWS. An EC2 instance is a virtual server in Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for running applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. Instance types comprise varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.  
  
2. perform a quick software update on your instance.
	It seems that we need to update the instance every time. Why no automatical update?
	
3. Install latest versions of the LAMP MariaDB and PHP packages for Amazon Linux 2. 

4. install the Apache web server, MariaDB, and PHP software packages. 

5. Start the Apache web server.

6.  Use the systemctl command to configure the Apache web server to start at each system boot.

7. Add a security rule.

8. Test your web server.

	I tried several times till the success of the test. The problem is the security rules. The security group you are using contains a rule to allow HTTP (port 80) traffic. 
	
Part Two: Test Your LAMP Server

1. Create a PHP file in the Apache document root.   
	
2. In a web browser, type the URL of the file that you just created. This URL is the public DNS address of your instance followed by a forward slash and the file name.
	Notes: It is "http://", not "https://".

3. Delete the phpinfo.php file.
	Notes: security reasons.

Part Three: Secure the Database Server

The default installation of the MariaDB server has several features that are great for testing and development, but they should be disabled or removed for production servers.

1. Start the MariaDB server.   
	
2. Run mysql_secure_installation.


#### S3 versus an EC2 VM

Time: 30 min   

- Amazon EC2

It's just kind of a regular computer hosted somewhere on one of AWS data-center. And, as part of that it has a hard-drive or local storage. And, it is not permanent in the sense that anything that you want to store long term you don't want to store on the hard-drive of EC2 instance because of scaling-up and scaling-down while adding easy to servers, vice-versa(maintaining Elasticity property). And, so you don't want to have things that you want to keep forever on to the local storage because as you add or remove instances then you can potentially lost that information or lose that data. EC2 is meant to deploy your application on server(using its processing power) and that server serve the contents through the S3 and RDS, respectively. Hence, Amazon EC2 good for any type of processing activity.

- Amazon S3

Amazon S3 stores data as objects in a flat environment (without a hierarchy). Each object (file) in the storage contains a header with an associated sequence of bytes from 0 bytes to 5 TB.  Amazon S3 is a storage platform of AWS. It's specially called large unlimited storage bucket(Limit is very high). So, S3 is perfect place for storing doc, movie, music, apps, pictures, anything you want to store, just dump onto S3. And, it's going to be multiple redundancies and back-up of files that you put there. So, again you are always going to have high availability of any files that you decide to store on S3. 
Uses of S3:
Mass storage container
Long-Term Storage

- Benefits of using Amazon S3 to store static assets such as pictures and videos:

    S3 is pay-as-you-go 
    
    S3 is highly available: You don't need to run any servers
    
    S3 is highly durable: Your data is duplicated across three data centres, so it is more resilient to failure
    
    S3 is highly scalable: It can handle massive volumes of requests. If you served content from Amazon EC2, you'd have to scale-out to meet requests
    
    S3 has in-built security at the object, bucket and user level.
    

- Amazon EC2 instance, and serve the content from the EC2 instance:

    You would need to pre-provision storage using Amazon EBS volumes (and you pay for the entire volume even if it isn't all used)
    
    You would need to Snapshot the EBS volumes to improve durability (EBS Snapshots are stored in Amazon S3, replicated between data centres)
    
    You would need to scale your EC2 instances (make them bigger, or add more) to handle the workload
    
    You would need to replicate data between instances if you are running multiple EC2 instances to meet request volumes
    
    You would need to install and configure the software on the EC2 instance(s) to manage security, content serving, monitoring, etc.
    

#### [QwikLab: Intro to DynamoDB](https://awseducate.qwiklabs.com/focuses/23?parent=catalog)  
Time: 20 min   


Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed proprietary NoSQL database service that supports key-value and document data structures and is offered by Amazon.com as part of the Amazon Web Services portfolio. DynamoDB exposes a similar data model to and derives its name from Dynamo, but has a different underlying implementation(from Wikipedia).

1. Create a new table.   
	In AWS management console, select Service, then select DynamoDB. Create new table.  
  
2. Add Data

3. Modify an existing item

4. Query the table

5. Delete the table

	Amazon DynamoDB is very good to be used as a cloud db.
	

#### [AWS Tutorial: Deploy a Scalable Nodejs Web App](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/deploy-nodejs-web-app/?trk=gs_card)  
Time: 60 min   

   This tutorial is about how to deploy a high-availability Node.js web app using AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Amazon DynamoDB. Using Elastic Beanstalk, you can simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. Elastic Beanstalk automatically scales your application up and down based on your application's specific need using easily adjustable Auto Scaling settings. Amazon DynamoDB is a fast and flexible NoSQL database service for all applications that need consistent, single-digit millisecond latency at any scale. It is a fully managed cloud database and supports both document and key-value store models.
   
1. Prerequisites.   

	This tuturial uses sample application source bundle from GitHub: eb-node-express-sample-v1.1.zip.  
  
2. Launch an Elastic Beanstalk Environment

	Elastic Beanstalk creates and manages severals resources.
   
3. Add Permissions to Your Environment's Instances

	The application runs on one or more EC2 instances behind a load balancer, serving HTTP requests from the Internet. When it receives a request that requires it to use AWS services, the application uses the permissions of the instance it runs on to access those services. 
   
4. Deploy the Sample Application

5. Create a DynamoDB Table

	Notes: When you create a table outside of Elastic Beanstalk, it is completely independent of Elastic Beanstalk and your Elastic Beanstalk environments, and will not be terminated by Elastic Beanstalk. 

6. Update the Application's Configuration Files

	Update the configuration files in the application source to use the nodejs-tutorial table instead of creating a new one. 

7. Configure Your Environment for High Availability

    Configure the environment's Auto Scaling group with a higher minimum instance count. Run at least two instances at all times to prevent the web servers in your environment from being a single point of failure, and to allow you to deploy changes without taking your site out of service. 
    
    
8. Cleanup

	Elastic Beanstalk terminates all AWS resources associated with your environment, such as Amazon EC2 instances, database instances, load balancers, security groups, and alarms. 



#### [QwikLab: Intro to AWS Lambda](https://awseducate.qwiklabs.com/focuses/36?parent=catalog)  
Time: 30 min   

   This lab demonstrates AWS Lambda by creating a serverless image thumbnail application.
   
1. Create the Amazon S3 Buckets.   

	This create two Amazon S3 buckets -- one for input and one for output.  
   
2. Create an AWS Lambda Function.   

	This create an AWS Lambda function that reads an image from Amazon S3, resizes the image and then stores the new image in Amazon S3.
   
3. Test Your Function.   

	This is done by simulating an event with the same information normally sent from Amazon S3 when a new object is uploaded.  
   
4. Monitoring and Logging.   

	Monitor AWS Lambda functions to identify problems and view log files to assist in debugging.  
   

#### [QwikLab: Intro to Amazon API Gateway](https://awseducate.qwiklabs.com/focuses/21?parent=catalog)  
Time: 35 min   

   This lab create a simple FAQ micro-service. The micro-service will return a JSON object containing a random question and answer pair using an Amazon API Gateway endpoint that invokes an AWS Lambda function. 
   
   The idea of a microservices architecture is to take a large, complex system and break it down into independent, decoupled services that are easy to manage and extend. This enables developers to meet their key design goals like extensibility, extendibility, availability and maintainability.
   
   Representational state transfer (REST) refers to architectures that follow six constraints: Clientâ€“server architecture, Statelessness, Cacheability, Layered system, Code on demand (optional), Uniform interface.
   
1. Create a Lambda Function.   

	This create two Amazon S3 buckets -- one for input and one for output.  
   
2. Test the Lambda function.


#### [AWS Tutorial: Build a Serverless Web Application](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/build-serverless-web-app-lambda-apigateway-s3-dynamodb-cognito/?trk=gs_card)  
Time: 120 min   

   This serverless web application takes me about 4 hours to finish. I almost do it twice to complete it.
   
   This lab create a simple serverless web application that enables users to request unicorn rides from the Wild Rydes fleet. 
   
   The application will present users with an HTML based user interface for indicating the location where they would like to be picked up and will interface on the backend with a RESTful web service to submit the request and dispatch a nearby unicorn. 
   
   The application will also provide facilities for users to register with the service and log in before requesting rides.
   
   The application architecture uses AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon Cognito.
   
   
 - Module 1. Static Web Hosting

	Architecture Overview:  

	The static web content including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images and other files will be stored in Amazon S3. Your end users will then access your site using the public website URL exposed by Amazon S3.  
	
   
	Implementation Instructions:

	The static web content including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images and other files will be stored in Amazon S3. Your end users will then access your site using the public website URL exposed by Amazon S3.  
	
   
   Steps:
   
1. Select a Region

	I always use the default region. 
	
2. Create an S3 Bucket

	Amazon S3 can be used to host static websites without having to configure or manage any web servers. A new S3 bucket that will be used to host all of the static assets (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files) for the web application.
	
3. Upload Content

	Upload the website assets for this module to your S3 bucket. You can use the AWS Management Console (requires Google Chrome browser).  It seems I could also do it with Firefox.
	
4. Add a Bucket Policy to Allow Public Reads

	You can define who can access the content in your S3 buckets using a bucket policy. Bucket policies are JSON documents that specify what principals are allowed to execute various actions against the objects in your bucket.
	
	This steps need to pay more attention. When I did it first time, the public was not enabled. The second time works. 
	
5. Enable Website Hosting

	This will make your objects available at the AWS Region-specific website endpoint of the bucket: .s3-website-.amazonaws.com. 
	
6. Validate your implementation

	Visit your website's base URL (this is the URL you noted in the prior section) in the browser of choice. You should see the Wild Rydes home page displayed. If you need to lookup the base URL, visit the S3 console, select your bucket and then click the Static Web Hosting on the Properties tab. 
	

 - Module 2. User Management

	Overview:  

	This module create an Amazon Cognito user pool to manage your users' accounts. Deploy pages that enable customers to register as a new user, verify their email address, and sign into the site.
	
	  Steps:
   
1. Create an Amazon Cognito User Pool

	Amazon Cognito provides two different mechanisms for authenticating users. You can use Cognito User Pools to add sign-up and sign-in functionality to your application or use Cognito Identity Pools to authenticate users through social identity providers such as Facebook, Twitter, or Amazon, with SAML identity solutions, or by using your own identity system. For this module you'll use a user pool as the backend for the provided registration and sign-in pages. 
	
2. Add an App to Your User Pool

	From the Amazon Cognito console select your user pool and then select the App clients section
	
3. Update the config.js File in Your Website Bucket

	The /js/config.js file contains settings for the user pool ID, app client ID and Region. Update this file with the settings from the user pool and app you created in the previous steps and upload the file back to your bucket.

4. Validate your implementation


- Module 3. Serverless Service Backend

	Overview:  

	Use AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB to build a backend process for handling requests for your web application. The browser application that you deployed in the first module allows users to request that a unicorn be sent to a location of their choice. In order to fulfill those requests, the JavaScript running in the browser will need to invoke a service running in the cloud.  
	
   
   Steps:
   
1. Create an Amazon DynamoDB Table

	Use the Amazon DynamoDB console to create a new DynamoDB table. Call your table Rides and give it a partition key called RideId with type String. The table name and partition key are case sensitive. 

2. Create an IAM Role for Your Lambda function

	Every Lambda function has an IAM role associated with it. This role defines what other AWS services the function is allowed to interact with. 

3. Create a Lambda Function for Handling Requests

	AWS Lambda will run your code in response to events such as an HTTP request. 

4. Validate Your Implementation

	Test the function that you built using the AWS Lambda console. 

- Module 4. RESTful APIs

	Overview:  

	Use Amazon API Gateway to expose the Lambda function you built in the previous module as a RESTful API. This API will be accessible on the public Internet. It will be secured using the Amazon Cognito user pool you created in the previous module. Using this configuration you will then turn your statically hosted website into a dynamic web application by adding client-side JavaScript that makes AJAX calls to the exposed APIs..  
	
   
   Steps:
   
1. Create a New REST API

	Select Services then select API Gateway under Application Services to create api.
	
	  
2. Create a Cognito User Pools Authorizer

	In this step you'll configure an authorizer for your API to use the user pool you created in Module 2.
	
3. Create a new resource and method

	Create a new resource called /ride within your API. Then create a POST method for that resource and configure it to use a Lambda proxy integration backed by the RequestUnicorn function you created in the first step of this module.
	  
4. Deploy Your API

	From the Amazon API Gateway console, choose Actions, Deploy API.
	  
5. Update the Website Config

	Update the /js/config.js file in your website deployment to include the invoke URL of the stage you just created.
	  
6. Validate your implementation

	Visit /ride.html under your website domain.


- Finally, Resource Cleanup. It is very important to clean the resource to avoid additional charging.


#### [AWS Tutorial: Build a Modern Web Application](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/build-modern-app-fargate-lambda-dynamodb-python/?trk=gs_card)  
Time: 150 min   

  - Again, this is a relatively difficult tutorial. I believe it is not easy to complete it in 150 minutes in first try.
  
  - This tutorial build a modern application on AWS. Modern applications are resilient, scalable collections of independent services that abstract away the underlying infrastructure. Modern application development leverages agile development practices, immutable deployments, and programmable infrastructure to continuously release new features to the business and end users.
  
  - Implement Mythical Mysfits using these modules:
  
    Create Static Website Build a static website, using Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) that serves static content (images, static text, etc.) for your website.
    
    Build Dynamic Website Host your application logic on a web server, using an API backend microservice deployed as a container through AWS Fargate.
    
    Store Mysfit Data Externalize all of the mysfit data and persist it with a managed NoSQL database provided by Amazon DynamoDB.
    
    Add User Registration Enable users to registration, authentication, and authorization so that Mythical Mysfits visitors can like and adopt myfits, enabled through AWS API Gateway and its integration with Amazon Cognito.
    
    Capture User Clicks Capture user behavior with a clickstream analysis microservice that will record and analyze clicks on the website using AWS Lambda and Amazon Kinesis Firehose. 
    

 - Module 1: Build a Static Website 
 
 	Host the static content (html, js, css, media content, etc.) of our Mythical Mysfit website on Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
	
	Steps:
  
1. Create A New AWS Cloud9 Environment.   

	On the AWS Console home page, type Cloud9 into the service search bar and select it. Click Create Environment on the Cloud9 home page.
   
2. Create An S3 Bucket And Configure It For Website Hosting.

	These Steps seem miss something. I add "git checkout python" after "aws s3 website s3://mythical-mysfits-bucket-lijun --index-document index.html" to make it success.
	
	
 - Module 2: Host Your Application On A Web Server
 

	In this module you will create a new microservice hosted with AWS Fargate.  

	AWS Fargate is a deployment option in Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) that allows you to deploy containers without having to manage any clusters or servers.
	
	With Fargate, you get the control of containers and the flexibility to choose when they run without worrying about provisioning or scaling servers. It offers full control of networking, security, and service to service communication and is natively integrated with AWS services for security, networking, access control, developer tooling, monitoring, and logging.
	
	
	Steps:
	
1. Setup Core Infrastructure

	create the core infrastructure environment that the service will use, including the networking infrastructure in Amazon VPC, and the AWS Identity and Access Management Roles that will define the permissions that ECS and our containers will have on top of AWS.
	
2. Deploy A Service With AWS Fargate

	Create a Docker container image that contains all of the code and configuration required to run the Mythical Mysfits backend as a microservice API created with Flask.
	
3. Automate Deployments using AWS Code Services

	Create a fully managed CI/CD stack that will automatically deliver all of the code changes that you make to your code base to the service you created during the last module..
	


 - Module 3: Store Mysfit Information
 

	In this module you will set up Amazon DynamoDB to store the mysfit information in a central database table.  

	Create a table in Amazon DynamoDB, a managed and scalable NoSQL database service on AWS with super fast performance. Rather than have all of the Mysfits be stored in a static JSON file, we will store them in a database to make the websites future more extensible and scalable.
	
	
	Steps:
	
1. Create A DynamoDB Table

	To create the table using the AWS CLI, execute the following command in the Cloud9 terminal: "aws dynamodb create-table --cli-input-json file://~/environment/aws-modern-application-workshop/module-3/aws-cli/dynamodb-table.json" 
	
2. Add Items To The DynamoDB Table

	To call this API using the provided JSON file, execute the following terminal command:  "aws dynamodb batch-write-item --request-items file://~/environment/aws-modern-application-workshop/module-3/aws-cli/populate-dynamodb.json"
	
3. Copy The Updated Flask Service Code

	To copy the new files into your CodeCommit repository directory, execute the following command in the terminal: "cp ~/environment/aws-modern-application-workshop/module-3/app/service/* ~/environment/MythicalMysfitsService-Repository/service/"
	
4. Copy The Updated Flask Service Code

	
5. Update S3

	Need to publish a new index.html page to our S3 bucket so that the new API functionality using query strings to filter responses will be used. 
	

  - Module 4: Setup User Registration
	
	Overview:
	
	In order to add some more critical aspects to the Mythical Mysfits website, like allowing users to vote for their favorite mysfit and adopt a mysfit, we need to first have users register on the website. To enable registration and authentication of website users, we will create a User Pool in AWS Cognito - a fully managed user identity management service. 
	

	Steps:
1. Create The Cognito User Pool

	To create the Cognito User Pool where all of the Mythical Mysfits visitors will be stored, execute the following CLI command: "aws cognito-idp create-user-pool --pool-name MysfitsUserPool --auto-verified-attributes email"

2. Create A Cognito User Pool Client

	
3. Create An API Gateway VPC Link

	Create the VPC Link for our upcoming REST API using the following CLI command: "aws apigateway create-vpc-link --name MysfitsApiVpcLink --target-arns REPLACE_ME_NLB_ARN"
	
4. Create The REST API Using Swagger

	Execute the following AWS CLI command:  "aws apigateway import-rest-api --parameters endpointConfigurationTypes=REGIONAL --body file://~/environment/aws-modern-application-workshop/module-4/aws-cli/api-swagger.json --fail-on-warnings"
	
5. Deploy The API

6. Update the Flask Service Backend

- Module 5: Capture User Behavior

	In this module you will capture user behavior using AWS Lambda and other serverless services. 
	
	Modern application design principles prefer focused, decoupled, and modular services.
	
	Create a new and decoupled service for the purpose of receiving user click events from the Mysfits website

	Lambda is great for data-driven applications that need to respond in real-time to changes in data, shifts in system state, or actions by users.
	
	Steps:
	
1.  Create A New CodeCommit Repository

	Create a new CodeCommit repository where the streaming service code will live: "aws codecommit create-repository --repository-name MythicalMysfitsStreamingService-Repository"
	
2.  Copy The Streaming Service Code Base

3.  Use Pip To Intall Lambda Function Dependencies

4.  Update The Lambda Function Code

5. Push Your Code Into CodeCommit

6. Create An S3 Bucket For Lambda Function Code Packages

7. Use The SAM CLI To Package Your Code For Lambda

8. Deploy The Stack Using AWS CloudFormation

9. Update The Website Content

10. Push The New Site Version to S3


- Cleanup. Be sure to delete all the resources created during the workshop in order to ensure that billing for the resources does not continue for longer than you intend. 


- Final summary: There are a lot of steps in this project. A good practice is to use a notepad to save the every steps input commands and output for later check, and save the screenshot for further check. There are some wrong steps in the official steps. Some steps are not very clear. So it is very important to understand every steps.
